# **AdventureWorks Power BI Project**

The **AdventureWorks Power BI Project** involves applying data preparation, data modeling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and dashboard design techniques to simulate real-world tasks that data professionals encounter daily.

This project walks through the various stages of data analysis using Power BI, from connecting to data sources, shaping the data, creating a data model, applying DAX for analysis, and building interactive reports and dashboards.


## **Project Overview**

In this project, we will focus on the following tasks:

- Connecting to data sources
- Transforming and shaping data using Power Query
- Building a relational data model
- Creating calculated fields using DAX
- Designing interactive reports and dashboards with Power BI

The objective is to simulate real-world tasks and build a professional, automated Power BI workflow.

## **Stage 1: Connecting & Shaping Data**

In this stage, we focus on building automated workflows to extract, clean, transform, and load project data using Power Query. Key tasks include:

- **Data connectors**: Connecting to different data sources
- **Storage & import modes**: Choosing the right storage options for the project
- **Query editing tools**: Utilizing advanced query tools in Power BI
- **Table transformations**: Transforming data for better analysis
- **Extracting data from the web**: Using web connectors for real-time data
- **QA & Profiling tools**: Ensuring data quality
- **Text, numerical, date & time tools**: Handling various data types
- **Rolling calendars & Index columns**: Creating time-based calculations
- **Merging & Appending queries**: Combining datasets for richer analysis

## **Stage 2: Creating a Relational Data Model**

In this stage, we review data modeling best practices and focus on creating a robust data model for AdventureWorks, including:

- **Database normalization**: Structuring data for efficiency
- **Fact & Dimension Tables**: Defining fact and dimension tables in the model
- **Primary & Foreign Keys**: Setting up relationships
- **Star & Snowflake schemas**: Choosing appropriate schema designs
- **Active & Inactive relationships**: Managing relationship flow
- **Cardinality & Filter Context**: Ensuring correct filtering behavior
- **Hierarchies**: Building hierarchical data for drill-down analysis

## **Stage 3: Adding Calculated Fields with DAX**

In this stage, we introduce Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create calculated columns and measures. Key topics include:

- **DAX vs. M**: Understanding the difference between M (Power Query) and DAX
- **Calculated columns & measures**: Creating fields to enhance data insights
- **Time Intelligence Patterns**: Applying time-based calculations like Year-to-Date (YTD)
- **CALCULATE, FILTER, and ALL**: Using DAX functions to filter and modify calculations
- **Iterators (X) Functions**: Performing row-by-row calculations
- **Text and Date Functions**: Enhancing data with conditional logic and text-based calculations

## **Stage 4: Visualizing Data with Reports**

Stage 4 focuses on bringing data to life with visualizations. In this stage, we cover:

- **Data visualization best practices**: Guidelines for clear and impactful visualizations
- **Dashboard design framework**: Building intuitive and user-friendly dashboards
- **KPIs, Line charts, and Trend Lines**: Visualizing key metrics and trends
- **On-object formatting**: Enhancing chart readability
- **Table & Matrix visuals**: Presenting detailed data in tables
- **Map visuals**: Geospatial data visualization
- **Drill-up, Drill-down, and Drillthrough**: Interactive data exploration
- **Report slicers & Interactions**: Allowing users to filter data dynamically
- **Bookmarks & Page Navigation**: Creating smooth transitions between different views
- **Custom Tooltips**: Adding insightful tooltips for better context
